<h2>How I got to where I am today</h2>
<h3>Hi, I'm Andrew Sportsman, a current student in BGSU Master's of Science in analytics program.</h3>
<p>Getting to this point in my academic career was quite the journey. I completed my undergraduate studies at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. When I started college, I knew I wanted to be in the realm of technology. This lead me to taking on the <a href="https://miamioh.edu/cca/academics/departments/etbd/index.html">Interactive Media Studies (IMS)</a> major and focus in game design. My studies consisted of design theory, the design/analysis of play, and working with beginner game developer tools like <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">GameMaker</a> and <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. I thoroughly enjoyed my time during class projects like creating new board games and working on the design and programming teams in a class acting as a small game studio. I loved the creative freedom of game design, but something was missing. I was unsure if I could make a career out of this or endure the grueling life of a game developer that my professors warned of.</p>
<p>One day in my Games and Learning course, a class focused on gamification, the professor had an IMS alumna call in for a video chat. At one point in the call, she spoke about her game studio using heat maps to analyze game levels in order to pinpoint parts of the game where players were quitting or getting stuck. I remember calling my dad as soon as class ended and telling him this was the first time I felt like I knew what I wanted to pursue in life. I would pair data analytics with game design and use analytics to make the games I love, better. So, I picked up the Business Analytics co-major offered by the Farmer School of Business at Miami. This program taught me that data analysis could open the doors of many industries, not just the gaming industry. With a new found passion, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Media Studies and a co-major of Business Analytics.</p>
<p>Fast forward through one year of working as a data analyst for the Career Center at Miami University and I've almost graduated with a Master's degree in Analytics. With my honed data analysis skills, I'm ready to continue pursuing what I began several years ago; using data analytics to improve and guide the process of game design, technology, business, or wherever I end up.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>  </div>
